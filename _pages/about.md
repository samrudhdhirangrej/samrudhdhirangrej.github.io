Hello!
I am a Research Scientist at [Samsung Artificial Intelligence Center (SAIC), Toronto](https://research.samsung.com/aicenter_toronto).
I earned my PhD from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), where I was supervised by [Prof. James J Clark](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~clark/).
My research interests include computer vision, multimodal learning and deep learning.
During my PhD, I also interned at Facebook, Inc.

I earned MS by Research from [IIIT-Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), where I was a member of the [Center for Visual Information Technology (CVIT)](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) and advised by [Prof. Jayanthi Sivaswamy](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/jsivaswamy/).

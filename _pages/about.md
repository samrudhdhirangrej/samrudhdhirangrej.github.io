Hello! I am a PhD student at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/). I am supervised by [Prof. James J Clark](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~clark/).
My research interests include computer vision and deep learning. Currently, I am working on visual attention models for partially observable scenes.
During my PhD, I also interned at Facebook, Inc.

I earned MS by Research from [IIIT-Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), where I was a member of the [Center for Visual Information Technology (CVIT)](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) and advised by [Prof. Jayanthi Sivaswamy](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/jsivaswamy/).

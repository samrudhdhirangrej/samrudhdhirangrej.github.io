Hello. I am a PhD student at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), supervised by [Prof. James J Clark](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~clark/).
My research interests are computer vision and deep learning. Currently, I am working on visual attention models in the partial observability scenario.

I completed MS by Research at [IIIT-Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), where I was supervised by [Prof. Jayanthi Sivaswamy](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/jsivaswamy/).
